🌿 Deep Learning for Plant Disease Classification

This project focuses on the automatic classification of plant diseases using Deep Learning techniques. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the model analyzes leaf images to accurately identify healthy plants and various disease conditions. Early detection of plant diseases helps farmers and agricultural experts take timely action, improving crop yield and reducing losses.

The system involves image preprocessing, data augmentation, model training, and evaluation using a labeled plant leaf dataset. The trained model can classify plant diseases based on visual symptoms such as spots, discoloration, and texture variations. This project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning in precision agriculture and smart farming systems.
